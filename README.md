# GIFScript
A tool for creating GIFs by writing JavaScript code. The core tool provides the user with high level vector graphics functions, tweens and tranformations on top of the Nashorn JavaScript engine. All functions are available through a command line tool, a simple GUI interface will also be implemented later in the project. Created as a part of GSoC 2016.

## Progress
The core vector graphics features are complete, with a flexible tweening system for animations. The GIF encoder is functional, but needs to be improved for efficiency.
Extensibility features ("modules"), higher level mathematics helpers, and a small GUI client will be implemented in the upcoming weeks.
